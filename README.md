#### Description:
- Conducted a comprehensive geospatial analysis of transport infrastructure in Kaduna Metropolis, Nigeria.
- Utilized ARCGIS Pro software to map and analyze the distribution of key transport nodes including airports, bus stops, and train stations.
- Created a detailed network map highlighting major roads, railways, and waterways to visualize connectivity within the metropolitan area.
- Incorporated geographical features such as rivers and urban boundaries to provide context for infrastructure placement.
- Produced a high-quality cartographic output with appropriate scale and north arrow for clear data presentation.
- Analyzed spatial relationships to identify areas of high connectivity and potential gaps in transport coverage.
- Contributed valuable insights for urban planning and transport policy recommendations to improve mobility within Kaduna Metropolis.
#### Tools Used: ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, Google Earth

#### Description:
- Conducted a comprehensive geospatial study of Niger State within Nigeria, focusing on key infrastructure and points of interest.
- Created a detailed location map of Niger State, accurately representing its boundaries and internal divisions.
- Identified and plotted numerous points of interest across the state, representing critical infrastructure, settlements, or resource locations..
- Mapped the highway network within Niger State, highlighting major transportation routes and connectivity between regions.
- Incorporated hydrological features, accurately representing major water bodies which play a crucial role in the state's geography and economy.
- Developed a clear and informative legend to distinguish between different map elements (points of interest, highways, and water bodies).
